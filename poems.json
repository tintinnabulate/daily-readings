            "poem": "Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.\nAs far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others,\neven to the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.\n\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.\nIf you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter,\nfor always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans.\n\nKeep interested in your own career, however humble;\nit is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.\nExercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.\nBut let this not blind you to what virtue there is;\nmany persons strive for high ideals,\nand everywhere life is full of heroism.\n\nBe yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love;\nfor in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.\nBut do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.\nMany fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\n\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.\nYou are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;\nyou have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you,\nno doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.\n\nTherefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.\nAnd whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life,\nkeep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,\nit is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.\n"
