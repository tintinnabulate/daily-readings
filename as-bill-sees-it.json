Without this\nfreedom, we have nothing at all.\nParadoxically, though, we can achieve no liberation from the\nalcohol obsession until we become willing to deal with those\ncharacter defects which have landed us in that helpless\ncondition. In this freedom quest, we are always given three\nchoices.\nA rebellious refusal to work upon our glaring defects can be\nan almost certain ticket to destruction. Or, perhaps for a\ntime, we can stay sober with a minimum of self-improvement\nand settle ourselves into a comfortable but often dangerous\nmediocrity. Or,finally, we can continuously try hard for those\nsterling qualities that can add up to fineness of spirit and\naction -- true and lasting freedom under God.\nGRAPEVINE, NOVEMBER 1960"},

In that case, we are asking God to do it our way.\nTherefore, we ought to consider each request carefully to see\nwhat its real merit is.\nEven so, when making specific requests, it will be well to add\nto each one of them this qualification: \"... if it be Thy will.\"\nTWELVE AND TWELVE, P. 102"},

Our\ndemands for emotional security and wealth, for personal\nprestige and power all have to be tempered and redirected.\nWe learn that the full satisfaction of these demands cannot\nbe the sole end and aim of our lives.
